## Introduction
Hello👋, Welcome to My technical assessment :)

**Tools**
  1. Selenium
  2. TestNg

## My Approach

- ✅ The first step for me was understanding the requirements and doing manual testing.

- ✅ Plan the Required test cases.

- ✅ I used Page Object Model Design

  
## Obstacles

- 😮‍💨 Some elements at the HTML DOM weren't visible, so I had to go to event listeners and remove blur.

- 😮‍💨 I discovered that the page didn't load all HTML elements, requiring you to use scrolling. Then, locate the elements.
  
- 😮‍💨 For suggested names, I needed to use fluent wait to write the first letter and wait for suggestions.


  
## Run the test

- 💪 Clone this repo.

- 💪 Add the dependencies into Your pom.xml file.
  
- 💪 Run "mvn clean test" .

- 💪 You can dynamically run this repo in chrome of firefox, **Ex:** "mvn clean test -Dbrowser="chrome""  .
